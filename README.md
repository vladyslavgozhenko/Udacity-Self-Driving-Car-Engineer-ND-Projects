**Term2, Project 1: Extended Kalman Filter Project

In the project [Extended Kalman Filter Project](https://github.com/wiwawo/Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project) I will utilize a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements.

**Term2, Project 2: Unscented Kalman Filter Project

In the project [Unscented Kalman Filter Project](https://github.com/wiwawo/Unscented-Kalman-Filter-Project) I will utilize an unscented kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements.
