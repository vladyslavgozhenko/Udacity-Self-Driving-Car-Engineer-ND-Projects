## Project list:

**Project 1: Extended Kalman Filter Project**

In the project [Extended Kalman Filter Project](https://github.com/vladyslavgozhenko/Extended-Kalman-Filter-Project) I will utilize a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements.

**Project 2: Unscented Kalman Filter Project**

In the project [Unscented Kalman Filter Project](https://github.com/vladyslavgozhenko/Unscented-Kalman-Filter-Project) I will utilize an unscented kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements.

</p>

In [CarND-Kidnapped-Vehicle-Project](https://github.com/vladyslavgozhenko/CarND-Kidnapped-Vehicle-Project.git) a robot has been kidnapped and transported to a new location! Luckily it has a map of this location, a (noisy) GPS estimate of its initial location, and lots of (noisy) sensor and control data.

In this project I will implement a 2 dimensional particle filter in C++. The particle filter will be given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step the filter will also get observation and control data.

**Project 4: PID-Control Project**
<p align='center'>
<img src="https://github.com/wiwawo/CarND-PID-Control-Project/blob/master/video/pid_anime.gif" width="480" alt="simulator" />
</p>

In [PID-Control Project](https://github.com/vladyslavgozhenko/CarND-PID-Control-Project/) I will utilize PID-Control method to calculate steering angle for a car.

---
**Project 5: CarND-MPC-Project**

In [CarND-MPC-Project](https://github.com/vladyslavgozhenko/CarND-MPC-Project) I'll implement Model Predictive Control to drive the car around the track. The simulator will provide coordinates of the desired car trajectory  and car's current coordinates and orientation. The model will calculate the steering angle and throttle. Additionally, there's a 100 millisecond latency between actuation commands.
