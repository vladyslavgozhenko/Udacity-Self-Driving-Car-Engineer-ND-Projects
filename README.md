# Term1, Udacity Self-Driving Car Nanodegree Program.

All projects from the Term1 will be saved in different branches of the following repository https://github.com/wiwawo/CarND-Term1/. It was done to avoid numerous repositories for projects from the same term.

## Project list:

**Project1: Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

In this project the left and right lanes will be annotated in video files.
